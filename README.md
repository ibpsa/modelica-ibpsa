# Modelica IBPSA library

This is the development site for the _Modelica IBPSA Library_ and its user guide.

Instructions for developers are available on the [wiki](https://github.com/ibpsa/modelica-ibpsa/wiki).

## Library description

The Modelica _IBPSA_ library is a free open-source library with basic models that codify
best practices for the implementation of models for building and community energy and control systems.

The development of the IBPSA library is organized through the IBPSA Project 1 (https://ibpsa.github.io/project1)
of the International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA).
The development was organized from 2012 to 2017 through the
Annex 60 project (http://www.iea-annex60.org) of the
Energy in Buildings and Communities Programme
of the International Energy Agency (IEA EBC).

This library is typically not used directly by end-users. Rather, it
is integrated by developers of other Modelica libraries for building and
community energy systems, who then distribute it to end-users as part of their
respective library.
Currently, the _IBPSA_ library is used as the core of these libraries:

 * _AixLib_, from RWTH Aachen University, Germany: https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/AixLib
 * _Buildings_, from LBNL, Berkeley, CA, USA: http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica
 * _BuildingSystems_, from UdK Berlin, Germany: http://www.modelica-buildingsystems.de
 * _IDEAS_ from KU Leuven, Belgium: https://github.com/open-ideas/IDEAS
