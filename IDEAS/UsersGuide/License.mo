<p><b>4. Designation of Derivative Works and of Modified Works</b> </p>
<p>The identifying designation of Derivative Work and of Modified Work must be different to the corresponding identifying designation of the Original Work. This means especially that the (root-level) name of a Modelica package under this license must be changed if the package is modified (besides fixing of errors, adding vendor specific Modelica annotations, using a subset of the classes of a Modelica package, or using another representation, e.g. a binary representation). </p>
<h4>5. [reserved]</h4>
<h4>6. Provision of Source Code</h4>
<p>Licensor agrees to provide You with a copy of the Source Code of the Original Work but reserves the right to decide freely on the manner of how the Original Work is provided. For the matter of clarity, Licensor might provide only a binary representation of the Original Work. In that case, You may (a) either reproduce the Source Code from the binary representation if this is possible (e.g., by performing a copy of an encrypted Modelica package, if encryption allows the copy operation) or (b) request the Source Code from the Licensor who will provide it to You. </p>

<p>Neither the names of Licensor (including, but not limited to, University of California, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, U.S. Dept. of Energy, UC, LBNL, LBL, and DOE), nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior permission of the Licensor.

The same applies to the licensing notice of this License in the Original Work. For the matter of clarity, &QUOT;author notice&QUOT; means the notice that identifies the original author(s). </p>
<p>You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work. </p>
<p>In case the Original Work or Derivative Work is not provided in Source Code, the Attribution Notices shall be appropriately displayed, e.g., in the documentation of the Derivative Work. </p>
<h4>9. Disclaimer of Warranty</h4>

This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. </p>
<h4>11. Termination</h4>
<p>This License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed in Section 2 and 5, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without observing these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations. This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to observe the conditions of this license. </p>
<h4>12. Termination for Patent Action</h4>
<p>This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor, any owners of the Original Work or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement through combinations of the Original Work under combination with other software or hardware. </p>
<h4>13. Jurisdiction</h4>
<p>Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
