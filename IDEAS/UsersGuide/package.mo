<i><b>Integrated District Energy Assessment by Simulation</b></i> 
(<code>IDEAS</code>) is a Modelica library that allows integrated transient simulation of 
thermal and electrical processes at neighborhood level. 
The <code>IDEAS</code> tool differs from existing building physics and 
systems based and electrical energy system based models by integrating 
the dynamics of the hydronic, thermal as well as electrical energy networks 
at both the building and aggregated level within a single model and solver.

<h4>Content</h4>
<p>
Main packages are listed below.
<ul>
<li>
<a href=modelica://IDEAS.Buildings>Buildings</a> contains component models for modelling building envelopes. 
</li>
<li>
<a href=modelica://IDEAS.Fluid>Fluid</a> contains component models for modelling hydronic systems. 
</li>
<li>
<a href=modelica://IDEAS.AirFlow>AirFlow</a> 
(and <a href=modelica://IDEAS.Fluid>Fluid</a>)contain component models 
for modelling ventilation systems. 
</li>
<li>
<a href=modelica://IDEAS.Electric>Electric</a> contains component models for modelling electric distribution grids. 
These models are not yet unit tested. If you experience any problems with these models, please let us know. 
</li>
<li>
<a href=modelica://IDEAS.Examples>Examples</a> contains example models that demonstrate 
the use of <a href=modelica://IDEAS.Buildings>Buildings</a> and <a href=modelica://IDEAS.Fluid>Fluid</a>.
